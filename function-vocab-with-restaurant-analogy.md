Understanding the vocabulary that goes along with working with user-defined functions in Python.

### 1. **Function**
Think of a **function** like a **restaurant kitchen**. The function is a place where something gets done, like cooking a dish. You give it ingredients (arguments), and it prepares a result (a dish). Every time you call the function, you’re asking the kitchen to make the same kind of dish.

### 2. **Argument**
An **argument** is like the **ingredients** you give to the kitchen. When you order a dish at a restaurant, you might request extra cheese, no onions, or a specific size. These are the things you provide to make the dish exactly how you want it. In programming, arguments are the specific values you send into the function so it knows what to do.

### 3. **Parameter**
A **parameter** is like the **ingredient list** on the kitchen’s recipe. It’s what the kitchen expects to get in order to make the dish. For example, a recipe might say “cheese,” “onions,” or “chicken.” The kitchen doesn’t know exactly what ingredients you’ll provide, but it knows it needs these things in some form to cook the dish. Parameters are the placeholders in the function that define what type of information it needs to work.

### 4. **Return Statement**
The **return statement** is like the **waiter bringing your dish** back to you. After the kitchen has cooked your food, it doesn’t just keep it; it sends it out to you. Similarly, after the function has done its job (like adding or changing something), it sends a result back to where it was called from. That result is returned by the **return statement**.

### Putting it all together:
- You **call** the kitchen (the function) to make a dish.
- You **give the kitchen ingredients** (arguments) based on the recipe's needs (parameters).
- The kitchen makes the dish and sends it back to you (the **return statement**).

So, in programming:
- A **function** is like the restaurant kitchen.
- **Arguments** are like the ingredients you give to the kitchen (the function).
- **Parameters** are the ingredients the kitche (the function) expects to receive.
- The **return statement** is the dish the kitchen (the function gives) back after it’s done what you asked it to do.
