Understanding the vocabulary that goes along with working with user-defined functions in Python.

### 1. **Function**
Think of a **function** like a **restaurant kitchen**. Like a kitchen, the function is a place where something gets done, such as cooking a meal. You give the function ingredients (arguments), and it prepares or makes something for you (a meal). Every time you call the function, you’re asking the kitchen  -- the function -- to make the same kind of meal.

### 2. **Argument**
An **argument** is like the **ingredients** you give to the kitchen. When you order a dish at a restaurant, you might request extra cheese, no onions, or a specific size. These are the things you provide to make the dish exactly how you want it. In programming, arguments are the specific values you send into the function so it knows what to do.

### 3. **Parameter**
A **parameter** is like the **ingredient list** on the kitchen’s recipe. It’s what the kitchen expects to get in order to make the meal. For example, a recipe might list “cheese,” “onions,” or “chicken.” as ingredients. The kitchen doesn’t know exactly what ingredients you’ll provide, but it knows it needs these ingredients in some form to cook the meal. Parameters are the placeholders in the function that define what information the function needs to work.

### 4. **Return Statement**
The **return statement** is like the **waiter bringing your meal** back to you at your table. After the kitchen has cooked your food, it doesn’t just keep it; the kitchen sends your meal out to you. Similarly, after the function has done its job (like adding several numbers or capitalizing the names of all the students in a class), it sends a result back to the line in your code where the function was called from. That result is returned by a **return statement**.

### Important Takeaways:
- You **call** the kitchen (the function) to make a meal.
- You **give the kitchen ingredients** (arguments) based on the ingredients list (parameters) for the recipe.
- The kitchen makes the meal and sends it back to you (with the help of a **return statement**).

So, in programming:
- A **function** is like the restaurant kitchen.
- **Arguments** are like the ingredients you give to the kitchen (the function).
- **Parameters** are the ingredients the kitchen (the function) expects to receive.
- The **return statement** is the meal the kitchen (the function) gives back after it’s done what you asked it to do.
